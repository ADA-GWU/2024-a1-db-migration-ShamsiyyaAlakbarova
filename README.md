<h2>1.Prerequisites.</h2> 
<p>I used SQL script in this assignment, so before you can use this application, you will need to ensure that you have PostgreSQL (pdAdmin) installed on your system. If you don't have PostgreSQL installed, you can visit the official website at https://www.postgresql.org/download/, and download for your OS.</p> 

<h2>2.Set Up Environment.</h2>
<p>Step 1. Go to my github repository (https://github.com/ADA-GWU/2024-a1-db-migration-ShamsiyyaAlakbarova).<br>Step 2. Press to green CODE button, and download the repository as a ZIP file.<br>
Step 3. Unzip the file.<br>
Step 4. Open pgAdmin on your computer and create your database there. Here, you will run the scripts and see an outputs. <br>
Step 5. To create a database press on "Servers". Then you will see PostgreSQL 16 as a dropdown. Right click on PostgreSQL 16 => Create => Database. Give a name to your db (for example "HW1") and press save button.<br>
Step 6. Now, you have your HW1 db. Right click on HW1 => press Query Tool button. Here you will run your scripts.<br>
Step 7. On the top left corner you will see folder icon. You should press on it, or just use Alt+O command. You should find files from my repo, that you downloaded, and start running them.<br>

Set up is DONE!<br>
